##Recurrent neural networks
###Scoring sentiment
###ROC curve & AUC
###Confusion matrix
###Threshold responds to what level of probability you need to confirm something is positive
###ROC curve you run it at different thresholds
###Need prob above thresholds
###TP from a confusion matrix TP/TP+ FP
###ROC - want area of curve to be as high as possible- closest to 1
###Good for defining performance of a classification model
###Discrimination threshold - how much evidence it needs at what point does my classification model
###If AUC is 1 there are only true positives
###Example 1 -6:53 roc-AUC-fraud to 7:21 50 epochs
###ROC Training data more accurate- because never seen the data before
###When threshold is 100% model is
###Zip takes a list and another and matches or zips them up
###Enumerate is similar
###Sentiment analysis Neural network for NLP
###Used in time series analysis & algo trading
###ANN - artificial neural network
###RNN good at modelling sequential data
###Ie time series
###Feedback loops help RNN remember
###I want to invest for retirement
###RNN is fed 1 word at a time
###They are forgetful but depending on your application you can define how many steps back they will go

###LSTM
###Binary crossentropy
###Using 50% threshold
###LSTM prediction
